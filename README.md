# ChatRoom
Chat room where users can communicate with one another either on a global basis where all the users are notified, or if they want to keep it a secret and communicate via a private chat. Application uses localhost as host. All text messages (whether it is a global or private message) are encrypted using a homemade version of ECB (Electronic Code Book) which utilizes DES (Data Encryption Standard). Clients can also send images to one another. The server logs all of this information.
To use this application compile and run Server.java first. Then, compile and run as many Client.java to have multiple users online and chat away!
